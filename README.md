### Create a Library Modules
* Define a new module
* Code the module
* Assign the dependency for the module
* Extract the JSON display code into a separate module

### Gradle Project Structure
* Is a review of directories and files
* Identifies purpose of each file and directory
* Differentiates file and directory types (IntelliJ, Java, or Gradle)

##### settings.gradle
Its main roles is to define all included submodules and to mark the directory root of a tree of modules, so you can only have one settings. gradle file in a multi-module project.
It will be executed before any build.gradle script and even before the Project instances are created.

### Gradle Build Directory
* What is used for?
  Is the directory which all artifacts are generated into.
* How can we manipulate it directly?
* Gradle clean task
  This task is able to remove any output files or directories we have defined for our task.
  **gradle -q clean**
* Change the location of the build directory
  In the **build.gradle** file set:
  **buildDir** = "<directory_name>"
  
### Gradle Wrapper
* What is the Gradle Wrapper?
  * Is the thin "layer" around Gradle
  * Checks to see that the requested version of Gradle is installed
  * Passes the command onto the real Gradle
* How do we use the Gradle Wrapper?
  * Running the Wrapper task
    $ **gradle wrapper**
    > Task:wrapper
    BUILD SUCCESFUL in 0s
    1 actionable task: 1 executed  
 
* Use the Gradle init command to create the wrapper
  * If we don't have the **gradle** directory and the **gradlew.sh** and **gradlew.bat** files, to generate them we run the following command:
    **gradle wrapper --gradle-version** <version_number>
    #####Ej:
    ```
    gradle wrapper --gradle-version 3.5 
    ```
### Gradle Tasks
* They are functions performed by Gradle
* Consist of one or more actions
* What you can tell Gradle to do

To see which are the Gradle task availables run the following command in the terminal:
``` 
gradle tasks
```

### Gradle Vew Tool
* What is the Gradle Vew Tool?
  * Is an alternate way of running Gradle tasks
  * Has its own GUI
  * Is useful when you are first learning Gradle
  
### Create new Gradle Tasks
* Creating simple tasks using Groovy
  * In the **build.gradle** file:
    ``` 
    task showDate {
        doLast{
           println "Current Date: " + new Date() 
        }
    }
    ```
  * To run the task open the terminal and:
    ``` 
    gradle showDate
    ```  
* Assigning task dependencies
  * Let's say that the **showDate** task depends on other tasks. In that case, we us **dependsOn**:
    ``` 
    task showDate {
        dependsOn build
        doLast{
           println "Current Date: " + new Date() 
        }
    }
    ```  
    * We can assign a **group** and a **description** to our custom task:
        ``` 
        task showDate {
            dependsOn build
            group = 'my tasks'
            description = 'Show current date'
            doLast{
               println "Current Date: " + new Date() 
            }
        }
        ```    
* Integrating with the Terminal tool and Gradle View

### Extend Gradle Tasks
* Extending DefaultTask
  * To implement a custom task class, you extend ***DefaultTask***.
  ##### Ej.:
  ``` 
  class ShowDate extends DefaultTask {
      String dateMessage = "Date is: "
  
      @TaskAction
      void showDate() {
          println dateMessage + new Date()
      }
  }
  
  // Tasks
  task showDate(type: ShowDate)
  ```
* Javadoc for DefaultTask
* Extending you own custom tasks
  ``` 
  task custommShowDate(type: ShowDate) {
      dateMessage = "Custom time is: "
  }
  ```
  
### Create a Gradle Plugin
##### Reasons for creating a plugin
* Create a module for a plugin
* Add the plugin module to the build script
* Use the task from the plugin
* May never create a plugin, but there are times when it's useful
* Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
* Allows reuse within your project and enterprise
* Allows you to make your plugin available to the world

To create a Gradle plugin, you need to write a class that implements the ***Plugin*** interface. 
When the plugin is applied to a project, Gradle creates an instance of the plugin class and calls the instanceâ€™s *Plugin.apply()* method. 
The project object is passed as a parameter, which the plugin can use to configure the project however it needs to. 
The following sample contains a greeting plugin, which adds a hello task to the project.

``` 
class GreetingPlugin implements Plugin<Project> {
    void apply(Project project) {
        project.task('hello') {
            doLast {
                println 'Hello from the GreetingPlugin'
            }
        }
    }
}

// Apply the plugin
apply plugin: GreetingPlugin
```
* The **buildScript** closure determines which plugins, task classes, and other classes are available for use in the rest of the build script. 
  Without a **buildScript** block, you can use everything that ships with Gradle out-of-the-box. If you additionally want to use third-party plugins, 
  task classes, or other classes (in the build script!), you have to specify the corresponding dependencies in the buildScript closure.
  The **buildScript** closure is for the **build.gradle** file itself.
